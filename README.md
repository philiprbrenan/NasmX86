Generate and run [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) using [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) as a powerful
macro [preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor) for [NASM - the Netwide Assember](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm). The [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) contained in this repository
contains useful methods to [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) you quickly [write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)) and [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)  making
this system an ideal development environment for any-one who wants to learn how
to [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) effectively in [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program).

The [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/NasmX86/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
in this repo shows how to [install](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)) [NASM - the Netwide Assember](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) and the [Intel Software Development Emulator](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html) used to [assemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) and
then run the [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) generated by this [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). 
This repository includes an implementation of 6/13 multi-way [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) using [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) instructions to perform key comparisons in parallel and [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) [arenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management) that are used to contain other [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) structures. The efficient implementation of
such multi-way [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) and areas enables the efficient implementation of other
dynamic [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) structures such as [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), stacks, [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), maps and [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)) libraries all of which are packed into [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas and addressed via [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). 

The use of [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas allows [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) structures to be created in one [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) then mapped to files via virtual paging or to a [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) to enable the [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) to be reused at a different location in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) by another [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). 

In particular position independent [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) can be placed in such areas,
indexed by a 6/13 [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) and then reloaded as a library of functions for reuse
elsewhere at a later date to make [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) generation efficient.


![5/13 Multiway Tree using avx512](http://prb.appaapps.com/MultiWayTree2.svg)

Such [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas work well with parallel processing: each child [sub](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html) [task](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/errata02/os/complete/part3-all-inclusive/langRef/technicalContent/task.html#task) can run in a separate [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) that creates an area of dynamic [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) structures
describing the results of the child's processing. The resulting areas  can be
easily transmitted to the parent [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) through a [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) or a [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) and then
interpreted by the parent regardless of the location in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) at which the
child [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) created the dynamic [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) structures contained in the transmitted
area.

# Unisyn

A parser for the [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) programming language has been built in [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) using
this [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software).  [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) implements a generic, universal, [utf8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) based syntax suitable for
constructing programming languages that make extensive use of [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operators.
 [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) enables the definition of new [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operators using selected [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) points. Each such new [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operator may have one of 12 precedence levels. The
precedence level for each [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operator is determined by the alphabet from
within [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) from which its letters are drawn.

For example, the [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operator: ```𝕒𝕟𝕕```  would have a priority of 3,
whilst ```𝗮𝗻𝗱``` would have a priority of 11.

The type of each lexical item in a [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) can be determined immediately
by examining any character used in its construction.

The canonical ```"Hello World"``` in Unisyn is:

```Hello World```

No quotes are needed because the use of letters drawn from [Ascii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) indicate that
these characters are part of a [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)).  [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) prints such [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) on
```stdout``` if they could have been preceded and followed by a statement
separator.


Given a [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) of [UniSyn](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/UnisynParse) :

```perl
  ParseUnisyn q(1＋𝗔✕𝗕＋𝗖𝕒𝕟𝕕2✕𝗔＋𝗕＋𝗖);
```

A sample [parse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) looks like this:

```perl
𝕒𝕟𝕕
._＋
._._✕
._._._＋
._._._._1
._._._._𝗔
._._._𝗕
._._𝗖
._＋
._._＋
._._._✕
._._._._2
._._._._𝗔
._._._𝗕
._._𝗖
```

And a sample execution:

```perl
Ascii: 1
Variable: 𝗔
Add
Variable: 𝗕
Times
Variable: 𝗖
Add
Ascii: 2
Variable: 𝗔
Times
Variable: 𝗕

And
```
