# Please get involved with this project!

Please join in with this interesting project - we need all the [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) we can get
to optimize the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) base - so much so that as an incentive to do so, we will
be pleased to offer you free Perl and Assembler training to [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) you make such
contributions to this project.

# Generate and run [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) using [NASM - the Netwide Assember](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) and [Perl](http://www.perl.org/)

Generate and run [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) using [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) as a powerful
macro [preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor) for [NASM - the Netwide Assember](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm). The [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) contained in this repository
contains useful methods to [help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_help) you quickly write and debug [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)  making
this system an ideal development environment for any-one who wants to learn how
to [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) effectively in [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). 
Full documentation is available at
[Nasm::X86](https://metacpan.org/pod/Nasm::X86).


The [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/NasmX86/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
in this repo shows how to [install](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)) [NASM - the Netwide Assember](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) and the [Intel Software Development Emulator](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html) used to [assemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler) and
then run the [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) generated by this [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). 
This repository includes an implementation of 6/13 multi-way [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) using [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) instructions to perform key comparisons in parallel and relocateble data [arenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management) that are used to contain other data structures. The efficient implementation of
such multi-way [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) and areas enables the efficient implementation of other
dynamic data structures such as [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), stacks, [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), maps and function
libraries all of which are packed into [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas and addressed via [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). 

The use of [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas allows data structures to be created in one [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) then mapped to files via virtual paging or to a [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) to enable the
data to be reused at a different location in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) by another [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). 

In particular position independent [X86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) can be placed in such areas,
indexed by a 6/13 [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) and then reloaded as a library of functions for reuse
elsewhere at a later date to make [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) generation efficient.

![5/13 Multiway Tree using avx512](http://prb.appaapps.com/MultiWayTree2.svg)

Such [relocatable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29) areas work well with parallel processing: each child [sub](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html) [task](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/errata02/os/complete/part3-all-inclusive/langRef/technicalContent/task.html#task) can run in a separate [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) that creates an area of dynamic data structures
describing the results of the child's processing. The resulting areas  can be
easily transmitted to the parent [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) through a [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) or a [socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) and then
interpreted by the parent regardless of the location in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) at which the
child [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)) created the dynamic data structures contained in the transmitted
area.

Other notable features provided by this repository include a parser for
**Unisyn** a generic, universal, [utf8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) based syntax for constructing programming
languages that can make extensive use of the operators and alphabets provide by
the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) standard.
